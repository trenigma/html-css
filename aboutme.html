    <p id="first">
    Hi! My name is Derek Ogletree aka "Tree".
<br>
     I'm a DevOps guy who enjoys learning "all the things."
    </p>
<p id"second">
  I've been in tech formally for 5 years. Growing up, I was always into technology but after trying to learn C++ 4 from a book on my own in sixth grade and finding myself compeletely overwhelmed, I became terrified of coding.
    </p id"third">
    Fast-forward a "few" years and now I'm well into learning Python, dabbling in Ruby and revisiting HTML, picking up some CSS along the way! I never thought that I could "be a coder" but thanks to encouragement from friends and awesome resources that I've been made aware of, I have a whole new outlook on what my career in tech CAN look like =).
